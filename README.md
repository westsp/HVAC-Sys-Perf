# HVAC-Sys-Perf
This repository explores the DOE Commercial Prototype Building Models data set with a focus on HVAC system-level energy performance.

This repository includes files to accompany the ASHRAE Conference Paper titled:  HVAC System-Level Energy Performance: Exploring the DOE Commercial Prototype Building Models.  The repository includes a Jupyter notebook file with a Python script for extracting energy end-use performance data from the prototype model output files.  The script iterates over multiple .html files in a folder (the data set was downloaded in July, 2020) using the BeautifulSoup library.  

This repository includes the raw scraped data in individual Excel workbook files for each ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and IECC publication vintage.  

This data set also includes some post-processing in Excel in order to isolate and aggregate energy use data specific to HVAC.
